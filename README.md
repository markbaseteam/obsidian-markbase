3. In the Obsidian plugin's settings, create a project and choose a folder/file to upload online
4. **You're done!** That folder should be live online in your own digital garden at https://<project-slug>.markbase.xyz (or at a custom domain if specified)

### Optional

1. *To resync your project if you've updated its contents, you can press the Sync button in the Obsidian plugin's settings, the ribbon (sidebar) or from the Command Pallette. This can be done once per hour (if you're on the free plan) or once per minute (if paid subscriber)*
2. *To delete a project, you can press the Delete button in the Obsidian plugin's settings or go to the [Markbase app](https://app.markbase.xyz)*
3. *To update your project to the latest theme/version, delete and re-create your project. Theme updates/bug fixes regularly occur!*
